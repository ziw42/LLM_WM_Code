It is a constitutional freedom that was designed to be difficult dismantle."], "4": ["First, because the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution is higher than law - laws cannot contradict the Constitution. That said, the exact meaning of the 2nd Amendment and its relation to whatever type of ban you're talking about is up for debate, so the more real answer is:@@@@@@Second, because a large percentage of Americans dont want it. Probably a majority are against \"banning all guns\", but enough oppose *any* sort of gun restrictions to stop any laws about it from being passed at the federal level. In fully blue states, there still just isn't the desire in the public or in state governments to ban all gun ownership, even if it was constitutional."], "3": ["If bans worked, then by that logic America would have no crime, no drugs, and no graffitti. You can ban whatever you want, but people who want to do bad don't seem to follow rules all that well."], "2": ["Well the second amendment has a long history of being read as if we didn\u2019t have a standing Federal Military. Then there is the logistics of purchasing back all of the guns, and if you owned the guns before the law took effect they would be grandfathered in. Banning firearms would be a decades long and multi-trillion dollar endeavor.", "Canada is a lot safer. There is no tyranny. The only gun crime is mostly imported from the US. Statistics is clear, but statistic don't move people emotionally, just like covid stats don't move antivaxxer who's set in their way of thinking."], "1": ["Because that is against our constitution. The right to bear arms against tyranny, especially in the context it's own government being the tyrant is one of our rights. Besides, banning drugs and alcohol didn't stop people from using them, so why would banning guns actually work in the first place? It would only stop the law abiding citizens from defense against those who aren't. Unfortunately, things aren't as cut and dry as you would like to believe.", "For one\u2026 it\u2019s very illegal. It\u2019s a constitutional right, second only to freedom of the press. The only way to do so would be another amendment, and I think it would be no exaggeration to say the population would be *up in arms* about it.@@@@@@There\u2019s also the technicality of once you\u2019ve banned all those guns, how are you going to get them from the people? Sure some would probably turn them in, buyback programs would get some more, but what about the rest? That\u2019d be a lot of shooting to pull that off.@@@@@@There\u2019s also the issue that banning guns won\u2019t get rid of them. Firearms is a huge industry, and there\u2019s a lot of demand. Just because people couldn\u2019t buy them in stores doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t get into the country. And I\u2019d also argue that many of the people motivated enough to carry out murders would find a way to do it without one. If they\u2019re motivated enough for mass shootings, they\u2019ll figure out how to get the guns anyway, or make a bomb instead.@@@@@@Finally, if you think tracking firearms can be troublesome now, imagine once they\u2019re banned. No registries (because they wouldn\u2019t be needed) makes it a lot harder to trace ownership and sourcing. Not something law enforcement would be thrilled to deal with I think.@@@@@@Yes, sometimes there are problems with guns. I\u2019m not denying it. But I firmly believe banning guns wouldn\u2019t solve very much, and might actually inflame a few issues.", "3 reasons. Formost it's the same reason we can't just ban hard drugs. I mean, cocaine is illegal ... but drugs are here anyway and criminals are still avoiding the law to sell them. So gang crime would be unaffected. Number two, there's good arguments for their use in personal protection. Third is a bit of a two-parter. Americans have a strong sense that they should be able to do something if it doesn't hurt anyone else. Coupled with the fact that the government is Constitutionally barred from simply taking away person property without the owner misusing it first, that means the government can only legally take guns away from criminals."], "0": ["Because it would be a terrible idea. The vast majority - like 99.9% of gun owners are no problem at all. The 2nd Amendment exists as a hedge against a tyrannical government, and that\u2019s very important as government gets bigger and bigger.
