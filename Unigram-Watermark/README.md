## Example

First, download the data by running the following command:

```
cd data
bash download_data.sh
```

You can generate watermarked text by running the following command:

```
python run_generate.py
```

You can detect the watermark by running the following command:

```
python run_detect.py --input_file {your_input_file}
```
