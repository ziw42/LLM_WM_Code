One way to shrink the size of a transistor is to reduce the thickness of a layer of silicon dioxide that is used to insulate the transistors. To do that, scientists need to understand the fundamental properties of this material, and one of those properties is the speed at which electrons move through it. But measuring that speed is not easy, because electrons move so fast that it takes a lot of equipment to measure them, and that equipment costs a lot of money. So a group of scientists at the University of California at Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory came up with a clever way to measure the speed of electrons through a layer of this material. The scientists used a laser to excite electrons in the material and then used a second laser to measure how long it took for those excited electrons to relax back to a lower energy state.
